This is a simple Express.js application which works as an example for a university course.

Requirements:
* Node.js
* Mongodb with a database named "expressjsapp" containing collection "users".

Application is done by mainly following tutorial found at [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnsO8-xJ8rs&t).

PLEASE NOTE! This application doesn't do any input validation so you shouldn't use this as a basis for any production application before you've added user input validation.
